# K-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, often abbreviated as KNN or k-NN, is a type of non-parametric, supervised learning method used for classification. It determines the classification of a data point based on the surrounding nearest neighbors in the feature space. The algorithm uses the closeness of adjacent data points to predict or classify where a new data point should belong.
There are several well-established libraries that provide implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. For instance, in Python, the scikit-learn library is a popular choice that offers a highly optimized version of KNN

# About
This is an repository showcasing a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, built from the ground up without relying on any high-level machine learning libraries. The dataset used in this repository is Analytics Vidhya Loan Prediction Dataset from Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/analytics-vidhya-loan-prediction]. This dataset comprises various attributes related to customers and their loan application details, including but not limited to Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, and Credit History. We will use KNN to predict Loan Eligibilitypredict which is the Loan_Status in this dataset.
